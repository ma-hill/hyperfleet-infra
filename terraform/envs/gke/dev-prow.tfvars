# HyperFleet GKE Developer Environment - Long-running Reserved Cluster Used for Prow
#
# Usage:
#   terraform init -backend-config=envs/gke/dev-prow.tfbackend
#   terraform plan -var-file=envs/gke/dev-prow.tfvars
#   terraform apply -var-file=envs/gke/dev-prow.tfvars
#
# This file configures the prow cluster only. CI integration clusters render
# from ci.tfvars.template via `make ci-tf-env`, so settings here do not leak
# into CI.
